**Cervical Cancer Prediction Project Description**

The project focuses on predicting the likelihood of cervical cancer in individuals using machine learning techniques. It incorporates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and classification models for accurate predictions. Key steps of the project are detailed below:

---

 **1. Data Preprocessing**
- The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and loaded into the environment.
- Initial data exploration is performed using `data.shape`, `data.info()`, and `data.describe()`.
- Missing values represented by '?' are replaced with NaN and subsequently filled with zeros.
- Zeros are replaced with the median values of the respective columns to handle missing data robustly.

---

 **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distributions of features like `Age` are visualized using Seaborn.
- Diagnostic tests (`Hinselmann`, `Schiller`, `Citology`, `Biopsy`) are analyzed using bar plots and count plots.
- Correlation matrices are visualized using heatmaps to identify feature relationships.

---

**3. Feature Engineering**
- A composite column, `count`, aggregates results from diagnostic tests. This is further used to derive a binary classification target variable, `result`.

---

**4. Model Development**
- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Implemented with and without K-fold cross-validation.
  - Provides metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
  - Optimal `k` value determined using Grid Search CV.
  - Model evaluation through confusion matrix and classification report.
- **Decision Tree**:
  - Utilized for direct prediction and evaluated with K-fold cross-validation.
  - Tree visualizations performed using Graphviz.
- **Random Forest**:
  - Employed as a robust ensemble method.
  - Evaluated using standard metrics and K-fold cross-validation.

---
 **5. Prediction System**
- A console-based system enables users to input personal information like age, number of pregnancies, etc., and receive cervical cancer risk predictions.
- The prediction logic is based on thresholds derived from model outputs:
  - Low probability: No risk.
  - Moderate to high probability: Stages I or II with doctor consultation advised.

---
**6. GUI Implementation**
- A user-friendly interface is built using the Gradio library.
- Users input their data through the GUI and receive immediate predictions.

---
**7. Decision Tree Visualization**
- Decision trees are plotted using the `tree.plot_tree()` method.
- Exported and visualized using Graphviz for detailed interpretation.

---
**Technologies and Libraries Used**
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Gradio, Graphviz
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Tools**: Graphviz for tree visualization

---
**Outcome**
- The project provides accurate predictions for cervical cancer risk based on user input.
- It incorporates advanced EDA, robust preprocessing, and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) simplifies user interaction and enhances accessibility.
